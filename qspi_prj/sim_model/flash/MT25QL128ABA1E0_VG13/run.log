Warning-[LCA_FEATURES_ENABLED] Usage warning
  LCA features enabled by '-lca' argument on the command line.  For more 
  information regarding list of LCA features please refer to Chapter "LCA 
  features" in the VCS/VCS-MX Release Notes


Warning-[DEBUG_DEP] Option will be deprecated
  The option '-debug_all' will be deprecated in a future release.  Please use 
  '-debug_acc+all -debug_region+cell+encrypt' instead.

The design hasn't changed and need not be recompiled.
